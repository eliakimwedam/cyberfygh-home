            What's Cybersecurity?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Cybersecurity, also known as information technology security,
            refers to the practice of protecting computer systems, networks,
            programs and sensitive information from unauthorized digital access, use, disclosure,
            disruption, modification or destruction (also known as cyberattacks).
            It is essential for protecting sensitive information, preventing identity theft and financial
            loses, safeguarding national security and critical infrastructure, ensuring
            business continuity and reputation, maintaining individual and organizational privacy.
            Cyber criminals use tactics like phishing, malware, SQL injection, cross-site scripting and
            denial of service attacks to exploit vulnerabilities.
            <br>
            The risks are real, with over 300 billion records compromised in 2020 alone and the global Cyber
            security market projected to reach $300 billion by 2024. Human errors causes 95%
            of cyber attacks, and the average cost of data breach is $3.86 million. To stay safe, use strong
            passwords, keep software up-to-date,
            be cautious with links and public Wi-fi, monitor accounts, use reputable antivirus software and backup
            important
            data. Beware of common threats like ransomware, phishing scams, identity theft, online harrasment and
            cryptojcaking.
            <br>
            To protect yourself, use passwords

            Cyberthreats
        </h2>
        <p>
            A cyberthreat is any potential malicious attempt to damage, disrupt, or gain
            unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or devices. These threats
            can come in various forms, such as viruses, ransomware, phishing attacks, and
            more, posing significant risks to the security, integrity, and privacy of
            digital information. Stay vigilant and proactive to safeguard against these
            threats.
